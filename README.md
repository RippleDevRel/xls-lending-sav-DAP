# XLS-66 Lending Protocol & XLS-65 SAV — DAP

A full-stack reference implementation of the XRP Ledger's lending amendments:
[**XLS-66** (Lending Protocol)](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0066-lending-protocol)
and [**XLS-65** (Single Asset Vault)](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0065-single-asset-vault).
Built as an open-source template for fintechs, asset managers, and devs who want a working starting point for lending/borrowing products on XRPL.

- Three roles — **Loan Broker**, **Depositor**, **Borrower** — each with a
  dedicated dashboard and wallet.
- Full loan lifecycle: origination (multi-sign), regular / late / early-full /
  overpayment repayment modes, default, and cleanup.
- Three asset types supported: **XRP**, **IOU**, **MPT** (XLS-33).
- On-chain correctness verified against the latest XLS-66 / XLS-65 / XLS-33
  master specs; every non-obvious calculation has a spec-section reference in
  the code.

## Quick Start

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local              # then edit MONGODB_URI
npm install
npm run dev                              # http://localhost:3000
```

Log in with any email/password. On first login the server generates four
wallets (broker, depositor, borrower, issuer), funds them via the devnet
faucet, and persists seeds in MongoDB for the session.

## Environment variables

| Variable           | Default                                              | Purpose                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `XRPL_NETWORK_URL` | `wss://s.devnet.rippletest.net:51233/`               | WebSocket endpoint                |
| `XRPL_FAUCET_URL`  | `https://faucet.devnet.rippletest.net/accounts`      | Devnet faucet                             |
| `MONGODB_URI`      | *(required, no default)*                             | Full MongoDB connection string            |

See `.env.example`. Network and faucet default to Devnet because XLS-66/65 are
only enabled there at the time of writing.

## Tech stack

- **Framework** – Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Turbopack)
- **Auth proxy** – `src/proxy.ts` (Next 16 convention, replaces `middleware`)
- **UI** – Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, Aceternity UI, Magic UI, Motion
- **XRPL** – xrpl.js v4 (includes XLS-65/66/33 validators and flag enums)
- **Database** – MongoDB (Mongoose) — see "On-chain vs off-chain" below

## Architecture: on-chain vs off-chain

**The XRPL ledger is the source of truth.** MongoDB caches only what's needed
to bridge HTTP requests between transactions.

### Written to the ledger

| Object / Tx                           | Path                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Vault` (XLS-65)                      | `VaultCreate` / `VaultDeposit` / `VaultWithdraw` / `VaultDelete` |
| `LoanBroker` (XLS-66)                 | `LoanBrokerSet` / `LoanBrokerCoverDeposit` / `LoanBrokerCoverWithdraw` / `LoanBrokerDelete` |
| `Loan` (XLS-66)                       | `LoanSet` (multi-sign) / `LoanPay` / `LoanManage` / `LoanDelete` |
| `MPTokenIssuance` + `MPToken` (XLS-33) | `MPTokenIssuanceCreate` / `MPTokenAuthorize`            |
| IOU trust lines                       | `TrustSet` + `AccountSet` (`asfDefaultRipple`)          |
| Faucet top-ups, peer transfers        | `Payment`                                               |

### Read from the ledger on every request

| Data                                               | Method                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Wallet XRP balance                                 | `account_info` → `Balance`               |
| IOU balance                                        | `account_lines` filtered by issuer       |
| MPT balance                                        | `account_objects` type `mptoken`         |
| Vault state (`AssetsTotal`, shares, MPTID, …)      | `vault_info` (returns the full entry)    |
| Loan / LoanBroker state                            | `ledger_entry` with the object id        |
| Validated close time (for interest accrual)        | `ledger` with `ledger_index: "validated"` |

### Stored off-chain (MongoDB, `src/lib/db/models/`)

| Collection       | Role                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Session`        | Email, password hash (scrypt), generated wallet seeds, current `vaultId` / `loanBrokerId` / `issuedToken` discriminator. **Seeds never leave the server.** |
| `Vault`          | Session ↔ `vaultId` mapping + asset record + cached `totalDeposited` / `sharesMinted`. Refreshed from `vault_info` on read. |
| `Loan`           | Session ↔ `loanId` mapping + immutable loan terms (copied from the `LoanSet` payload at origination) + cached `paymentsRemaining` / `principalOutstanding` / `status`. |
| `DepositHistory` | Audit trail of every `VaultDeposit` / `VaultWithdraw`, with tx hash, amount, type, timestamp. Used for PNL in the depositor view. |

**MongoDB is never the source of truth for balances or state** — every
protected route re-reads the ledger after a tx and after a page load. The DB
exists so the frontend can render without doing a full ledger scan on every
render and so historical tx data survives the ephemeral `Loan` / `Vault`
ledger entries (they're deleted at cleanup).

### Sync flow after a write

```
1. Build tx with lib/xrpl builders (buildVaultCreate, buildLoanSet, …)
2. Sign (or multi-sign for LoanSet)
3. submitAndWait → ledger processes in next close
4. assertTxSuccess() checks meta.TransactionResult === "tesSUCCESS"
5. Re-query the ledger (vault_info / ledger_entry) for fresh state
6. Update the matching Mongo document with the unscaled on-chain values
7. Return the tx hash + minimal cache to the client
```

## Amount conventions (important for forkers)

The three supported asset types represent amounts differently on-chain; the
template normalizes this at API boundaries:

| Asset | On-ledger                                   | DB / API payloads                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| XRP   | integer **drops** (1 XRP = 1 000 000 drops) | drops                                 |
| IOU   | decimal string, up to 16 sig figs           | decimal string                        |
| MPT   | integer, scaled by `AssetScale` (demo = 2)  | **decimal string** (scaled at tx boundary) |

MPT scaling is the only place the client and the ledger disagree. Helpers in
`src/lib/xrpl/helpers.ts` scale / unscale at the exact two boundaries where
this matters:

- `buildAmountField(issuedToken, humanAmount)` — builds the `Amount` field
  for `VaultDeposit` / `VaultWithdraw` / `LoanPay` / `Payment` and scales
  up for MPT.
- `unscaleVaultNodeForMPT(vault, isMPT)` / `unscaleLoanNodeForMPT(node, isMPT)`
  scale down every amount-typed field before the API returns a ledger entry
  to the client.

Rate fields (`InterestRate`, `LateInterestRate`, `CloseInterestRate`,
`OverpaymentInterestRate`, `OverpaymentFee`, `ManagementFeeRate`,
`CoverRateMinimum`, `CoverRateLiquidation`) are always in **1/10 bps** on the
ledger (1 unit = 0.001%). Conversions live in `src/lib/constants.ts`:

```ts
percentToTenthBps(1)   // 1000        — UI % → on-chain units
bpsToTenthBps(500)     // 5000        — stored bps → on-chain units
tenthBpsToPercent(5000) // 5          — on-chain units → display %
```

## Loan math

All spec-critical calculations live in `src/lib/loan-math.ts` and are
deliberately isolated from UI and network code so they're easy to reuse
server-side or port to other clients.

| Function                 | XLS-66 reference            | Output                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `amortize(...)`          | §A-2.1 formulas (5)–(7)     | `{ periodicPayment, totalOutstanding, totalInterest }` |
| `earlyFullPayment(...)`  | §A-3.2.4 (early close)      | `{ accruedInterest, prepaymentPenalty, totalDue }` |
| `latePayment(...)`       | §A-3.2.2 (late payment)     | `{ lateInterest, totalDue }`                  |

For full-repay and late-repay modes the server re-computes the total on the
latest validated ledger close time via
`computeFullPaymentAmount` / `computeLatePaymentAmount` in
`src/lib/xrpl/helpers.ts`, so client clock drift can't push the amount below
the ledger's threshold.

## LoanPay flags (XLS-66 §A-3.3)

| Flag                  | Value      | When we set it                                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `tfLoanLatePayment`   | `0x040000` | Auto-set when `now > Loan.NextPaymentDueDate`                       |
| `tfLoanFullPayment`   | `0x020000` | UI "Pay in full" mode                                              |
| `tfLoanOverpayment`   | `0x010000` | UI "Overpayment" mode; loan must have been created with `tfLoanOverpayment` set on `LoanSet` |

Without the appropriate flag the ledger either rejects the tx or falls
through to the regular-installment path, which is why the close fees / late
fees configured at origination don't appear to be enforced unless the flag is
present.

## Cleanup order

Deleting a vault requires dismantling the dependency chain first:

```
For each active loan:
LoanManage (tfLoanDefault) → LoanDelete
LoanBrokerCoverWithdraw
LoanBrokerDelete
VaultDelete
```

`/api/vault/delete` runs this entire sequence in one call. Any out-of-order
step surfaces as `tecHAS_OBLIGATIONS`.

## User flow

```
Login (email) → 4 wallets created + faucet-funded
 ├── Broker    → Create vault → Register broker (+ first-loss cover) → Issue loan → Manage / default
 ├── Depositor → Deposit → Track PNL → Withdraw
 └── Borrower  → View loan → Make payment (installment / late / full / overpayment / custom)
```

## API surface

All routes below are described by an **OpenAPI 3.1** spec at
[`docs/openapi.yaml`](./docs/openapi.yaml). While running the dev server
the same file is served from:

- `GET /api/openapi` — raw YAML (or JSON with `Accept: application/json`)
- `GET /api/docs` — Swagger UI rendering of the spec

All routes are protected by `src/proxy.ts` — a valid `xls66-auth`
cookie (MongoDB ObjectId of the session) is required. `sessionId` is read
from the cookie, never the body, so cross-session IDOR is impossible.
Public exceptions: `POST /api/session`, `GET /api/openapi`, `GET /api/docs`,
and the `/terms` page.

## Security notes

- **Password storage**: scrypt + random 16-byte salt, compared with
  `timingSafeEqual`. See `src/lib/auth.ts`.
- **Session routing**: `sessionId` always read from the httpOnly cookie,
  never from a request body or query — `src/proxy.ts` gates every API route
  and `requireAuthSession()` re-validates on the handler.
- **Server-side validation**: every amount / number / id is validated before
  being used in a tx. See `src/lib/validation.ts`.
- **On-chain verification**: `assertTxSuccess(result, txType)` throws on
  anything other than `tesSUCCESS`, so the DB never records an assumed state.
- **Demo wallets are server-controlled.** For a production app where each
  role is a real user, move wallet key material to the client (or to a
  dedicated KMS) and have the client co-sign `LoanSet`.

## Out of scope (TBD)

- Private vaults with `PermissionedDomain` credentials (XLS-80)
- Collateralized loans using `TokenEscrow` (XLS-85)
- Batch issuance with XLS-56
- Secondary share market (vault share trading)
